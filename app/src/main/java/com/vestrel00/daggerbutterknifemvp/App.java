 * <b>DEPENDENCY INJECTION</b>
 * We could extend {@link dagger.android.DaggerApplication} so we can get the boilerplate
 * dagger code for free. However, we want to avoid inheritance (if possible and it is in this case)
 * so that we have to option to inherit from something else later on if needed
 * (e.g. if we need to override MultidexApplication).
